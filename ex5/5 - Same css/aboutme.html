			<h3>About me</h3>

			<p>Hey! My name is Lars, and I'm a 3. year student at NTNU, on Informatikk. My hometown is Sandefjord, aka summerfjord, aka THE FJOORD, and have been in Trondheim for 2 og my 21 years in life. I enjoy a long trip by the beach, apple martinis, and relaxing on my wool carpet by my fireplace. Besides my interests in computers and programming, I'm into graphical design, and getting BIGGG lifting weights all duhy!! No, but yeah. I have also spent many years doing gymnastics, skating, and other kinds of activities.</p>

			<h3>This course</h3>

			<p>I've chosen Webtechnology, because I'm very interested in learning basic HTML, CSS and Jacascript; I mean hey.. knowledge of webapplications is in the wind, huh? </p>
