					<h1>Graffi</h1>
				</div>
				<div class="box">
					<h2 id="#top">Page title</h2>
					<p>
						On this website, there is only one page with anchors between each subject in the navigation menu and it’s location on the page. There are therefore also only one page title. This page title only say: “Graffi ·”. No matter which part of the content you are reading, the title never describes the content of the “page”. It also have no brief description of what “Graffi” is.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="box">
					<h2>Image text alternatives</h2>
					<p>
						There are many pictures on this site which only have a cosmetic function. The home section of the page shows two large photos, which fades to different photos after a few seconds (Doesn’t work in FireFox). These use a number from 1-5, but since they are purely cosmetic, they could also just have used null-alts (alt=””), so that doesn’t matter much. Later on in the “about us” section, a picture spread with the alt-text: ”picture-spread” is, and lastly there are two more cosmetic pictures about table reservation that actually have a good description in their alt-text.<br><br>

						In the “about us” section of the page, there is a grid of pictures (2x4). These are from an Instagram widget, and can be clicked on to be linked to the widget: “snapwidget.com”, where you can comment and share them. These doesn’t have any alt-text, which is unfortunate, because they have a function.<br><br>

						In the “table ordering” section, where they talk about their catering services, there is a picture-link which takes the user to their catering fixer. This picture doesn’t have any alt-text at all, and should have one, as it includes an important service for this website. It does, however have a plain link to the catering service as well right beneath the picture.<br><br>

						Lastly, there are two big pictures of menus; the lunch- and dinner menu. These serves as links to their menus, and have the following alt-texts: “lunch-spread”, and “dinner-spread”, which is acceptable. 
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="box">
					<h2>Headings</h2>
					<p>
						This site has one heading with the h1 on it’s page, which serves as a home button, and lies right in the middle of the navigation menu. The headings for each section the navigation menu will take the user use the h2 tag. Lastly, in the section with information about Graffis restaurants, they use the h4 tags for the heading for each of the two restaurants.<br><br>

						They follow a hierarchical structure for their headings quite well.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="box">
					<h2>Contrast ratio</h2>
					<p>
						This website has a good contrast ratio all over. It features a white background, with a dark/black header and navigation menu, with mostly black text. The headings are dark gray, links are standard blue, and all text is easily readable from the white background.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="box">
					<h2>Resize text</h2>
					<p>
						When resizing the text, all text gets larger. No text disappears or gets cut off, nothing overlaps, and there is no need to suddenly have to use horizontal scrolling. An issue, however, is that all the h2 headings are images. They will therefore not change size.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="box">
					<h2>Keyboard access and visual focus</h2>
					<p>
						The keyboard access on this site have some issues. The navigation menu is not possible to target with tabbing, and the section headings h2 are also not possible to tab to. From home (top of page), tabbing will logically take you downwards and target all links, including image-links, so all functionality is possible with just a keyboard, just a little more excessive.<br><br>

						The visual focus, however, is barely there. Only the images provided by the instagram widget: “snapwidget.com”, are showing sign of focus when tabbed to, with a thin dotted line around them. None of the links or image-links have any visual focus at all.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="box">
					<h2>Forms, labels and errors</h2>
					<p>
						The only functionality present on this website is clicking links and anchors, so there are no labels, form, and not much space for errors at all. No links are broken, so there are no errors to be found.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="box">
					<h2>Multimedia alternatives</h2>
					<p>
						There is no video or audio on this website.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="box">
					<h2>Basic structure check</h2>
					<p>
						When turning off css and images, it’s still fairly easy to obtain any information you need, and use all of the sites links. The image-links have alternative plain links you can use, so all functionality is still there. A problem is that the ease of navigation is gone, because of the sites structure. It consists of only one page, and without the css, the navigation menu is no longer fixed. You have to scroll to the top of the page if you want to jump to the sections you are after. This is not that much of a problem, however because without the css and cosmetic images, the site is fairly small. By scrolling down you, you see the information you want under each heading, and the links you need.<br><br>

						The image alt-texts describes fairly well what the images are, except the cosmetic pictures, but this isn’t a big problem.

					<h1>Familien</h1>
				</div>
				<div class="box">
					<h2>Page title</h2>
					<p>
						Familiens webpage consists of one home page and three subpages. The supages do offer different content and information, but the title, that is the title tag in the HTML is the same. The webpage would be better serverd if the title refelcted the content of that subpage.
					</p>
				</div>
			
				<div class="box">
					<h2>Image text alternatives</h2>
					<p>
						The "alt" attribute is only used once, on the Facebook button, but is lacking on the other images and links. The three links on the home page, directing the user to the subpages, should have had the "alt" attribute. The same goes for the menu bar at the bottom of every subpage.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="box">
					<h2>Headings</h2>
					<p>
						There are only one heading on each of the subpages, these are encapsulated by a div class named title, but do not use the HTML tag h1. This makes the page harder to be interpreded by an screen reader.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="box">
					<h2>Contrast ratio</h2>
					<p>
						The default contrast on the webpage is good, with a white background and black text. The website doesn't offer any tools to change the background color, nor the text color. That would be a job for the browser.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="box">
					<h2>Resize text</h2>
					<p>
						The font size is defined by the stylesheet. The div surrounding the content has a fixed width, so on zooming, altough the text gets bigger, the width of the div also gets bigger and exceeds the browser window. 
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="box">
					<h2>Keyboard access and visual focus</h2>
					<p>
						It is possible to tab trough all the links on the webpage. When you are on a link, you get a visual focus telling you which link you can access by hitting enter, this goes also for images that are links. It is also possible to tab away, that is the last tab before you start at the first link. Though we suspect these are features that Google Chrome offer, and are not a part of the website design.<br><br>

						The objects which you can tab to are only links, there are no multimedia content on this webpage. So you do get access to all the functionality the site offers. There are no dropdown list on the website, hence it's not possible to check if that is tabable.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="box">
					<h2>Forms, labels and errors</h2>
					<p>
						There are no forms or labels, hence it's not possible to get an error message because of form handling. But there isn't a 404-page either, you only get presented with a standard "Not Found" page served by the Apache server.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="box">
					<h2>Multimedia alternatives</h2>
					<p>
						There are no multimedia content on the page.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="box">
					<h2>Basic structure check</h2>
					<p>
						With the images turned off and the CSS unlinked, the page shows all the text without any formating. This is because whoever developed the site haven't used any HTML tags in the formating, except "p". E.g. the headings had their own CSS class.<br><br>

						Since the website doesn't offer much information in the first place, it doesn't suffer to much from this. But there aren't any aids from the website to help screenreaders and such. Hence, the site isn't optimized for those with special needs.

			<h1 class="main" id="opg2">Our website</h1>
			<h2>Purpose</h2>
			<p>
				The main goal of our website is to promote a student bar and provide relevant information to potential customers. The main content will be about the bar, its services, the menu, the location and a shedule of happenings. It will act as a easy way for customers to come in contact with the bar, to book tables or to place an order. One of the side points about the website is also to set the mood or style of the bar, and to give customers a feel for the place.
			</p>

			<h2>Titled pages</h2>
			<div class="siteMap">
				<ul>
					<li>Home page</li>
					<li>Menu
						<ul>
							<li>Menu</li>
							<li>Takeaway menu</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Happenings</li>
					<li>About the bar
						<ul>
							<li>History</li>
							<li>Contact</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Sitemap</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			
			<p>
				The website is for now consisting of 9 pages, as shown on the site-structure.
			</p>
	
			
			
			<h2>Potential audience</h2>
			<p>
				Due to this being a student bar, the target audience will be young people at the age of 20 to 30. Hence, it will need to be a responsive website with a modern interface that works on several devices. Based on the same reasoning, we will not take older browser into consideration.
			</p>

			<h2>Multimedia content</h2>
			<p>
				As a graphical element on the webpage, we wish to use an embeded video that’s playing in the background, either on the front page, or on a suitable subpage. The purpose of the video is to reflect the mood in the bar. Most likely, this will be a video from Youtube or Vimeo.
			</p>

			<h2>Interaction with dynamic features</h2>
			<p>
				The website will use a template framework, so that we don’t have to duplicate any code. The content of each page will most likely be gathered from a XML document using JavaScript.<br><br>

				We will use JavaScript to create interactive navigation, making it easier for the user to navigate the page. The navigation will mostly be hierarchical, but there will be a linear navigation between the menus.
			</p>

			<h2>Where the content is gathered</h2>
			<p>
				The content will mainly be created by us, due to this being a non-existing bar. Though the content will be inspired by similar sites, especially the parts that falls outside of our domain, e.g. the menu.
			</p>

			<h2>What we learned reviewing similar sites</h2>
			<p>
				After evaluating the familien.in webpage, we’ve seen the importance of using correct HTML tags to make the site semantic correct. That is, so that other applications, like the browser or a screenreader, can convey the content as the sender intends. The Familien webpage had a lack of basic HTML tags, and Firefox didn’t recognize the utf-8 tag, which made all nordic letters unreadable. Chrome is probably smart enough to guess what charset to use.<br><br>

				Navigating the HTML and CSS documents were made more time consuming than necessary due to the CSS being split into at least six different files. Thus making it harder to solve problems and edit code.<br><br>

				After evaluating the graffigrill.no webpage, we've seen that all only having one page may be a good solution when it comes to keeping it easy and simple, by using a fixed anchor menu, it can bring some problems. This beeing e.g. that you can't show the user where he/she is on the page by looking at the title, and if the CSS isn't working, it can be hard to navigate.<br><br>

				Having headers as images doesn't support resizing the text on the page, which may hurt those who rely on this function, and should probably avoided if possible.<br><br>

				By comparrison, these two websites should offer the same, but doesn't. familien.in lack a lot of information which is essential to a user, like information about food and drinks beeing offered etc. It's clear that you have to think as a user of the website; what would you want to find on such a website? And build it after that.
